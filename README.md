Cider Falls Park Web Site
You have been contracted to build an interactive web site for a public park in your county - Cider Falls. Here are the features that the administrator of the park wants to have.

Destinations
There are six major destinations in the park. This application will display information about the park areas, their services, and about the guests. We will only track first and last name for each guest.

In the northeast section, there is the Chamfort River that supports rafting, canoeing, and fishing.
In the northern section, there is the Lost Wolf Hiking Trail that supports hiking, picnicking, and rock climbing.
In the northwest section, the main attraction is the Lodge, but there is also a hotel, and a restaurant. This area supports lodging, parking, information, and picnicking.
In the southwest section, there is the Gander River, which is a natural preserve, so it only supports fishing and hiking.
In the southern section, the main attraction is the Campgrounds. Ther eis also the office park, and children play areas. This area supports information, lodging, and parking.
In the southeast section, there is the Pine Bluffs Trails, a vast network of trails for all levels of hikers. On the beginner trail, there are food vendors. This area support hiking, picnicking, and zip lines.
Each section should have a title (e.g. Lost Wolf Hiking Trail).
Each section should display the services is supports (e.g. hiking).
General Layout
The administrator wants the park logo and park name at the top of the page. She wants the main phone number, email address, and street address at the bottom of the page.

All of the areas should be displayed in the proper location in a layout of two rows, and three columns.

The areas grid should be in the main content area of the page, and left aligned.

The names of all current park guests should be listed in the main content area of the page, and right aligned.
